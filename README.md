# Taxation Perception
A sentiment analysis on how taxation is perceived in Romania.
We've questioned 709 Romanian people on how they perceive the national tax system. We've analyzed their reponses to
three questions:
1. What displeases you about the Romanian tax system ?
2. If you were the Minister of Public Finance, what would you change about the Romanian tax system? 
3. In your opinion, what does the current tax system offer you?  

Based on the responses, we've computed word frequencies to deliver a word cloud of the most frequent words for each
question and we've computed sentiment scores based on a pre-trained sentiment analysis BERT model, which was trained on
a Romanian database and can be downloaded from https://github.com/stefanacioban/romanian_sentiment_predictor.
